**Commander** is a basic Spigot/Paper/Bukkit plugin used to launch shell commands from within the server console or the game. It requires the user to have OP or to have access to the server console. 

>[!CAUTION]
>Commander should only be used as a testing tool with a permission from the server owner, otherwise its usage may be considered hacking and may not be legal!
